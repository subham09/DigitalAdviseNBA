## Description
This repository serves as a starting point for developing a next best action recommendation system. It is intended for trial and testing purposes, and the results will be used to refine and optimize the system. As the project progresses, unnecessary components will be trimmed or cleaned to ensure a streamlined and efficient solution.

      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - For macOS and Linux:
